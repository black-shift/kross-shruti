I am Shruti Solanki, a contemporary, self-taught artist based in New Delhi. Growing up, crafts were a huge part of my life- always making, breaking, and putting things together. As I grew up, crafts became a memory as higher education and other interests became central in life. After pursuing a bachelor's in business then a diploma in education, Art found its way back in my life. As I entered the field of education, a completely new understanding of arts came forth and my interest in the field grew as it became a therapeutic exercise. My work involves dealing with my own struggles with vulnerability, acceptance and healing.

Having lived in a multicultural city, constantly exposed to popular culture, while having roots in a village tucked away in the corner of this city, the grandeur of Indian mythology, and the simplicity and fluidity of nature had a great influence on my work. An equilibrium of fluidity and control, thus became the focal point of my work.

When the pandemic slowed down life, that is when my work graduated from small sketchbooks to large colourful canvases as my experiments with different mediums began. My toolbox expanded from my pens and notebook to acrylics, oils, resin, threads, and inks. Eventually, I got opportunities, earlier this year, to exhibit my work across the country.
