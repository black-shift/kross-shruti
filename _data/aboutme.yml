# About Section
blurb: My work is characterized by a dynamic blend of control and chaos, drawing on a diverse range of sources for inspiration. Drawing on the raw beauty of nature and the enduring influence of popular culture, as well as the rich tapestry of contemporary Indian society, I seek to explore the depths of the human experience and the many states of mind that exist beyond the chaos and imperfections of everyday life. Through my art, I aim to find a sense of serenity and acceptance in the fleeting reality of existence, and to offer a unique and thought-provoking perspective on the complexities of the world around us.
